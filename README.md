# ScanMonitorApps

## Overview

ScanMonitorApps is a mobile application designed to help Jump staff monitor ticket scanner activities during sports games. It provides real-time visibility into scanning operations, enabling staff to ensure smooth entry processes and quickly identify potential issues without leaving their posts or accessing desktop systems.

## Features

- Display of total scan counts over the last 2 hours
- Auto-refresh of metrics every 5 minutes
- Manual refresh via pull-to-refresh gesture
- Offline mode with cached data when network is unavailable
- Clear status indicators for data freshness and connectivity
- Simple, high-contrast UI designed for stadium environments

## Architecture

ScanMonitorApps uses a client-only architecture with a modern MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. It directly integrates with the Datadog API to retrieve scanning metrics without requiring a backend server.

For detailed architecture documentation, see [High-Level Architecture](docs/architecture/high_level_architecture.md).
